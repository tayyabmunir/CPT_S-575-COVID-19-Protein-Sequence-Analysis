# COVID-19-Protein-Sequence-Analysis
## S Protein Sequence Analysis and Visualization:

We have identifed how S protein was mutated over the last one year.We
divided our data into quarters . We parsed our data and used different approaches to analyse
the data to come up with the sequence of results to identify the actual spike on the disease as
well as how the DNA sequences varied with time. We used the hierarchy of sequences to
execute the list of tasks for this project which not only helped us to perform our tasks
efficiently as well as gave us the desired results.

### DataSet: 
1. Main dataset with unique sequences : sequencesData.csv
 - data/sequencesData-JanToMarch.csv
 - data/sequencesData-AprToJune.csv
 - data/sequencesData-JulToSep.csv
2. To analyze reference sequence: MN908947.fna


### Results:
